### `npm start`

Run command npm install in root directory as well as in client direcotry to  install the required dependencies. <br/>
Run the frontend use commaind ```npm start ``` in the client directory.<br/>
Run the backend app use command ``` nodemon ``` in root directory <br/>
Wooho Here you go , Go on browser and hit enter on url http://localhost:3000/ <br/>

For the very first it will take time to load the full app as per the heavy data in backend through api.<br/>
